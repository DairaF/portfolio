At this stage of conceptual development, I was asked to develop a feature for the law where it had a comment system like Google Docs has. Due to time and resource constraints, we opted to make a static version without a backend, unsing only hmtl, css, javascript and bootstrap.</p><p> In the second part of this project, we focused on developing a friendly navigation flow access a big amount of diverse information of different types. Dividing the data into categories and filter it by tags. The css development was done together with a colleague, and I was tasked with making it functional in PHP so that it can be used as a WordPress template.</p>",
